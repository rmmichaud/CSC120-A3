Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
George Rogers
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
None 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think there's a lot of differences in syntax and specifics that I'm really unfamiliar with, which makes it hard to 
judge it correctly. Once I got past that, I found it easy and honestly pretty similar to Python. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think most programming languages are based on the same basic concepts, such as loops, methods, imported functions, lists/arrays, etc. I would guess that the main differences live in syntax, as well as the public/private classes. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I initially tried to do a series of if statements to replace the mirrored words, which I soon realized was not necessary. I also tried directly replace the mirrored words, which didn't work. I realized I would need to use temporary replacements that I would then replace, which worked much better. Keeping these variables ordered was very helpful so I wouldn't mix them up, as they weren't very clear in their naming. This was mostly because if I used the mirrored words in the temporary replacement variable names, it caused issues. It definitely would have been preferable to use more specific variable names. For someone taking this class in the future, I would recommend approaching this assignment with a lot of patience, because it is very easy to get frustrated with the syntax differences when starting with Java. I would also recommend consulting the website the profs. provide for how to do things in Java. That was very helpful and alleviated some of the frustrating by showing me the necessary syntax for everything.
